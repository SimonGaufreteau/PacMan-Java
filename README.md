# PacMan Java
## About
This is a simple PacMan game coded with Java and using the JavaFX library for graphics.

## But why ?
Learn threads / concurrency + MVC applied to a simple video game.

## How to use it
Simply install javafx on your computer, build the project and start the MainVue class. 

## Tips
Look at the menubar to change the difficulty and the number of ghosts. Note that only the first difficulty selected will be applied.

When PacMan is blue, he can eat ghosts for a short period of time (this happens after eating a big bonus). 

When PacMan is red, he cannot take any damage for a short period of time.
